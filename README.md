# SCT_DataScience_Task3
Build a decision tree to predict whether a person will purchase a product based on their demographics and behavioral data.

Key Learnings:

1. Performed data cleaning and label encoding for categorical variables
2. Split the dataset into training and test sets (80/20)
3. Achieved an accuracy of 90.99%
4. Gained insights from the confusion matrix and classification report

While the model achieved a solid accuracy, the confusion matrix revealed that it predicted the 'No' class well but struggled with 'Yes' predictions. The classification report showed lower recall and F1-score for the 'Yes' class, highlighting the effect of class imbalance.
This hands-on task helped me understand how model complexity, feature encoding, and evaluation metrics influence classification performance.
